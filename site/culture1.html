            The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, is a traditional Chinese festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month on the lunar calendar. 
            The Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for reuniting with family members, as well as moon gazing. The festival is considered to be the second most important festival in China, after the Chinese New Year.

        <h2> Origination and Celebration</h2>
        <p>
            The Mid-Autumn Festival originated during the Shang Dynasty, and has been celebrated for over 3,000 years. It is often celebrated while doing many actions such as eating mooncakes, lighting lanterns, and moongazing.
            The story of Chang'e, the moon goddess is often told during the festival. The legend tells the story of how Chang'e drank a potion of immortality to protect it from falling into the hands of a villian, however was then sent to the moon as a result. 
            Her husband, Hou Yi (the archer who shot down 9 of the 10 suns) was left on earth, and would offer sacrafices to her every year on the 15th day of the 8th month.
            Although this tradition has faded over time, it is still celebrated today in many parts of China and other East Asian countries such as Vietnam and Korea.
