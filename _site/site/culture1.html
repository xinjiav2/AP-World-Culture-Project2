            This page is dedicated to the Mid-Autumn Festival, an important traditional festival in Chinese culture. Celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, it is a time for family reunions, moon gazing, and enjoying mooncakes. The festival honors the full moon and the legend of Chang'e, the Moon Goddess. Families gather to appreciate the bright full moon, share stories, and indulge in festive foods. Lanterns are often lit and displayed, creating a beautiful and festive atmosphere. The Mid-Autumn Festival symbolizes harmony, prosperity, and the importance of family in Chinese culture.

        <h2> Origination and Celebration</h2>
        <p>
            The Mid-Autumn Festival has its origins in ancient moon worship and agricultural celebrations. It is believed to have started during the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC) and became more prominent during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). The festival is celebrated with various customs, including eating mooncakes, lighting lanterns, and performing dragon and lion dances. In modern times, it remains a significant cultural event, with people of all ages participating in festivities both in China and in Chinese communities worldwide. Specific examples of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations in my life are going outside to look at the moon, as well as eating mooncakes. This is important to me because it is a time where my family can come together and celebrate our culture. It represents my identity as a Chinese immigrant to the United States.
